Data Model
=============
The data model was designed to keep to the original data's structure as closely as possible. There were mostly minor changes as a result of following the `PEP8 guidelines <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ such as turning variable names from using ``camelCase`` to ``under_scores``.

Each `football-data.org resource <http://api.football-data.org/docs/v1/index.html#_resources>`_ is mapped into an object. Each value in a JSON resource is mapped to an attribute of the object. You can access these values using the syntax ``Object.attribute``. For example:
::

    >>> import pyfootball
    >>> f = pyfootball.Football('your_api_key')
    >>> my_team = f.get_team(5)
    >>> my_team.name
    FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen
